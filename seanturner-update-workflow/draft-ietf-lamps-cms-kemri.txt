1.  Introduction

   This document updates the The Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)
   [RFC5652].

   The Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) enveloped-data content type
   [RFC5652] and the CMS authenticated-enveloped-data content type
   [RFC5083] support both key transport and key agreement algorithms to
   establish the key used to encrypt and decrypt the content.  In recent
   years, cryptographers have been specifying Key Encapsulation
   Mechanism (KEM) algorithms, including quantum-secure KEM algorithms.
   This document defines conventions for the use of KEM algorithms for
   the CMS enveloped-data content type and the CMS authenticated-
   enveloped-data content type.

   A KEM algorithm is a one-pass (store-and-forward) mechanism for
   transporting random keying material to a recipient using the
   recipient's public key.  This means that the originator and the
   recipients do not need to be online at the same time.  The
   recipient's private key is needed to recover the random keying
   material, which is then treated as a pairwise shared secret (ss)
   between the originator and recipient.

   The KEMRecipientInfo structure defined in this document uses the
   pairwise shared secret as an input to a key derivation function (KDF)
   to produce a pairwise key-encryption key (KEK).  Then, the pairwise
   KEK is used to encrypt a content-encryption key (CEK) or a content-
   authenticated-encryption key (CAEK) for that recipient.  All of the
   recipients recieve the same CEK or CAEK.

   In this environment, security depends on three things.  First, the
   KEM algorithm must be secure against adaptive chosen ciphertext
   attacks.  Second, the key-encryption algorithm must provide
   confidentiality and integrity protection.  Third, the choices of the
   KDF and the key-encryption algorithm need to provide the same level
   of security as the KEM algorithm.

   A KEM algorithm provides three functions:

   *  KeyGen() -> (pk, sk):

      Generate the public key (pk) and a private key (sk).

   *  Encapsulate(pk) -> (ct, ss):

      Given the recipient's public key (pk), produce a ciphertext (ct)
      to be passed to the recipient and shared secret (ss) for the
      originator.

   *  Decapsulate(sk, ct) -> ss:

      Given the private key (sk) and the ciphertext (ct), produce the
      shared secret (ss) for the recipient.

   To support a particular KEM algorithm, the CMS originator MUST
   implement the KEM Encapsulate() function.

   To support a particular KEM algorithm, the CMS recipient MUST
   implement the KEM KeyGen() function and the KEM Decapsulate()
   function.  The recipient's public key is usually carried in a
   certificate [RFC5280].

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.2.  ASN.1

   CMS values are generated using ASN.1 [X.680], which uses the Basic
   Encoding Rules (BER) and the Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER)
   [X.690].

1.3.  CMS Version Numbers

   As described in Section 1.3 of [RFC5652], the major data structures
   include a version number as the first item in the data structure.
   The version number is intended to avoid ASN.1 decode errors.  Some
   implementations do not check the version number prior to attempting a
   decode, and then if a decode error occurs, the version number is
   checked as part of the error handling routine.  This is a reasonable
   approach; it places error processing outside of the fast path.  This
   approach is also forgiving when an incorrect version number is used
   by the originator.

   Whenever the structure is updated, a higher version number will be
   assigned.  However, to ensure maximum interoperability, the higher
   version number is only used when the new syntax feature is employed.
   That is, the lowest version number that supports the generated syntax
   is used.

2.  KEM Processing Overview

   KEM algorithms can be used with three CMS content types: the
   enveloped-data content type [RFC5652], the authenticated-data content
   type [RFC5652], or the authenticated-enveloped-data content type
   [RFC5083].  For simplicity, the terminology associated with the
   enveloped-data content type will be used in this overview.

   The originator randomly generates the CEK (or the CAEK), and then all
   recipients obtain that key as an encrypted object within the
   KEMRecipientInfo encryptedKey field explained in Section 3.  All
   recipients use the originator-generated symmetric key to decrypt the
   CMS message.

   A KEM algorithm and a key-derivation function are used to securely
   establish a pairwise symmetric key-encryption key (KEK), which is
   used to encrypt the originator-generated CEK (or the CAEK).

   In advance, each recipient uses the KEM KeyGen() function to create a
   key pair.  The recipient will often obtain a certificate [RFC5280]
   that includes the newly generated public key.  Whether the public key
   is certified or not, the newly generated public key is made available
   to potential originators.

   The originator establishes the CEK (or the CAEK) using these steps:

   1.  The CEK (or the CAEK) is generated at random.

   2.  For each recipient:

       *  The recipient's public key is used with the KEM Encapsulate()
          function to obtain a pairwise shared secret (ss) and the
          ciphertext for the recipient.

       *  The key-derivation function is used to derive a pairwise
          symmetric KEK, from the pairwise ss and other data that is
          optionally sent in the ukm field.

       *  The KEK is used to encrypt the CEK for this recipient.

   3.  The CEK (or the CAEK) is used to encrypt the content for all
       recipients.

   The recipient obtains the CEK (or the CAEK) using these steps:

   1.  The recipient's private key and the ciphertext are used with the
       KEM Decapsulate() function to obtain a pairwise ss.

   2.  The key-derivation function is used to derive a pairwise
       symmetric KEK, from the pairwise ss and other data that is
       optionally sent in the ukm field.

   3.  The KEK is used to decrypt the CEK (or the CAEK) .

   4.  The CEK (or the CAEK) is used to decrypt the content.

3.  KEM Recipient Information

   This document defines KEMRecipientInfo for use with KEM algorithms.
   As specified in Section 6.2.5 of [RFC5652], recipient information for
   additional key management techniques are represented in the
   OtherRecipientInfo type, and they are each identified by a unique
   ASN.1 object identifier.

   The object identifier associated with KEMRecipientInfo is:

     id-ori OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) member-body(2) us(840)
       rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs-9(9) smime(16) 13 }

     id-ori-kem OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-ori 3 }

   The KEMRecipientInfo type is:

     KEMRecipientInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
       version CMSVersion,  -- always set to 0
       rid RecipientIdentifier,
       kem KEMAlgorithmIdentifier,
       kemct OCTET STRING,
       kdf KeyDerivationAlgorithmIdentifier,
       kekLength INTEGER (1..65535),
       ukm [0] EXPLICIT UserKeyingMaterial OPTIONAL,
       wrap KeyEncryptionAlgorithmIdentifier,
       encryptedKey EncryptedKey }

   The fields of the KEMRecipientInfo type have the following meanings:

      version is the syntax version number.  The version MUST be 0.  The
      CMSVersion type is described in Section 10.2.5 of [RFC5652].

      rid specifies the recipient's certificate or key that was used by
      the originator with the KEM Encapsulate() function.  The
      RecipientIdentifier provides two alternatives for specifying the
      recipient's certificate [RFC5280], and thereby the recipient's
      public key.  The recipient's certificate MUST contain a KEM public
      key.  Therefore, a recipient X.509 version 3 certificate that
      contains a key usage extension MUST assert the keyEncipherment
      bit.  The issuerAndSerialNumber alternative identifies the
      recipient's certificate by the issuer's distinguished name and the
      certificate serial number; the subjectKeyIdentifier alternative
      identifies the recipient's certificate by a key identifier.  When
      an X.509 certificate is referenced, the key identifier matches the
      X.509 subjectKeyIdentifier extension value.  When other
      certificate formats are referenced, the documents that specify the
      certificate format and their use with the CMS must include details
      on matching the key identifier to the appropriate certificate
      field.  For recipient processing, implementations MUST support
      both of these alternatives for specifying the recipient's
      certificate.  For originator processing, implementations MUST
      support at least one of these alternatives.

      kem identifies the KEM algorithm, and any associated parameters,
      used by the originator.  The KEMAlgorithmIdentifier is described
      in Section 4.

      kemct is the ciphertext produced by the KEM Encapsulate() function
      for this recipient.

      kdf identifies the key-derivation algorithm, and any associated
      parameters, used by the originator to generate the KEK.  The
      KeyDerivationAlgorithmIdentifier is described in Section 10.1.6 of
      [RFC5652].

      kekLength is the size of the KEK in octets.  This value is one of
      the inputs to the key-derivation function.  The upper bound on the
      integer value is provided to make it clear to implementers that
      support for very large integer values is not needed.
      Implementations MUST confirm that the value provided is consistent
      with the key-encryption algorithm identified in the wrap field
      below.

      ukm is optional user keying material.  When the ukm value is
      provided, it must contain at least one octet, and it is used as
      part of the info structure described in Section 5 to provide a
      context input to the key-derivation function.  For example, the
      ukm value could include a nonce, application-specific context
      information, or an identifier for the originator.  A KEM algorithm
      may place requirements on the ukm value.  Implementations that do
      not support the ukm field SHOULD gracefully discontinue processing
      when the ukm field is present.  Note that this requirement expands
      the original purpose of the ukm described in Section 10.2.6 of
      [RFC5652]; it is not limited to being used with key agreement
      algorithms.

      wrap identifies a key-encryption algorithm used to encrypt the
      CEK.  The KeyEncryptionAlgorithmIdentifier is described in
      Section 10.1.3 of [RFC5652].

      encryptedKey is the result of encrypting the CEK or the content-
      authenticated-encryption key [RFC5083] (CAEK) with the KEK.
      EncryptedKey is an OCTET STRING.

4.  KEM Algorithm Identifier

   The KEMAlgorithmIdentifier type identifies a KEM algorithm used to
   establish a pairwise ss.  The details of establishment depend on the
   KEM algorithm used.  A Key derivation algorithm is used to transform
   the pairwise ss value into a KEK.

  KEMAlgorithmIdentifier ::= AlgorithmIdentifier{ KEM-ALGORITHM, {...} }

5.  Key Derivation

   This section describes the conventions of using the KDF to compute
   the KEK for KEMRecipientInfo.  For simplicity, the terminology used
   in the HKDF specification [RFC5869] is used here.

   Many KDFs internally employ a one-way hash function.  When this is
   the case, the hash function that is used is indirectly indicated by
   the KeyDerivationAlgorithmIdentifier.  Other KDFs internally employ
   an encryption algorithm.  When this is the case, the encryption that
   is used is indirectly indicated by the
   KeyDerivationAlgorithmIdentifier.

   The KDF inputs are:

      IKM is the input key material.  It is a symmetric secret input to
      the KDF which may use a hash function or an encryption algorithm
      to generate a pseudorandom key.  The algorithm used to derive the
      IKM is dependent on the algorithm identified in the
      KeyDerivationAlgorithmIdentifier.

      L is the length of the output keying material in octets which is
      identified in the kekLength of the KEMRecipientInfo.  The value is
      dependent on the key-encryption algorithm that is used which is
      identified in the KeyEncryptionAlgorithmIdentifier.

      info is contextual input to the KDF.  The DER-encoded
      CMSORIforKEMOtherInfo structure is created from elements of the
      KEMRecipientInfo structure.  CMSORIforKEMOtherInfo is defined as:

         CMSORIforKEMOtherInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
           wrap KeyEncryptionAlgorithmIdentifier,
           kekLength INTEGER (1..65535),
           ukm [0] EXPLICIT UserKeyingMaterial OPTIONAL }

   The CMSORIforKEMOtherInfo structure contains:

      wrap identifies a key-encryption algorithm; the output of the key-
      derivation function will be used as a key for this algorithm.

      kekLength is the length of the KEK in octets; the output of the
      key-derivation function will be exactly this size.

      ukm is optional user keying material; see Section 3.

   The KDF output is:

      OKM is the output keying material with the exact length of L
      octets.  The OKM is the KEK that is used to encrypt the CEK or the
      CAEK.

   An acceptable KDF MUST accept an IKM, L, and info as inputs.  An
   acceptable KDF MAY also accept a salt input value, which is carried
   as a parameter to the KeyDerivationAlgorithmIdentifier if present.
   All of these inputs MUST influence the output of the KDF.

6.  ASN.1 Modules

   This section provides two ASN.1 modules [X.680].  The first ASN.1
   module is an extension to the AlgorithmInformation-2009 module in
   [RFC5912], and it defines the KEM-ALGORITHM CLASS.  The second ASN.1
   module defines the structures needed to use KEM Algorithms with CMS
   [RFC5652].

   The first ASN.1 module uses EXPLICIT tagging, and the second ASN.1
   module uses IMPLICIT tagging.

   Both ASN.1 modules follow the conventions established in [RFC5911],
   [RFC5912], and [RFC6268].

7.  Security Considerations

   The Security Considerations of [RFC5652] are applicable to this
   document.

   To be appropriate for use with this specification, the KEM algorithm
   MUST explicitly be designed to be secure when the public key is used
   many times.  For example, a KEM algorithm with a single-use public
   key is not appropriate because the public key is expected to be
   carried in a long-lived certificate [RFC5280] and used over and over.
   Thus, KEM algorithms that offer indistinguishability under adaptive
   chosen ciphertext attack (IND-CCA2) security are appropriate.  A
   common design pattern for obtaining IND-CCA2 security with public key
   reuse is to apply the Fujisaki-Okamoto (FO) transform [FO] or a
   variant of the FO transform [HHK].

   The KDF SHOULD offer at least the security level of the KEM.

   The choice of the key-encryption algorithm and the size of the KEK
   SHOULD be made based on the security level provided by the KEM.  The
   key-encryption algorithm and the KEK SHOULD at least have the
   security level of the KEM.

   KEM algorithms do not provide data origin authentication; therefore,
   when a KEM algorithm is used with the authenticated-data content
   type, the contents are delivered with integrity from an unknown
   source.

   Implementations MUST protect the KEM private key, the KEK, the CEK
   (or the CAEK).  Compromise of the KEM private key may result in the
   disclosure of all contents protected with that KEM private key.
   However, compromise of the KEK, the CEK, or the CAEK may result in
   disclosure of the encrypted content of a single message.

   The KEM produces the IKM input value for the KDF.  This IKM value
   MUST NOT be reused for any other purpose.  Likewise, any random value
   used by the KEM algorithm to produce the shared secret or its
   encapsulation MUST NOT be reused for any other purpose.  That is, the
   originator MUST generate a fresh KEM shared secret for each recipient
   in the KEMRecipientInfo structure, including any random value used by
   the KEM algorithm to produce the KEM shared secret.  In addition, the
   originator MUST discard the KEM shared secret, including any random
   value used by the KEM algorithm to produce the KEM shared secret,
   after constructing the entry in the KEMRecipientInfo structure for
   the corresponding recipient.  Similarly, the recipient MUST discard
   the KEM shared secret, including any random value used by the KEM
   algorithm to produce the KEM shared secret, after constructing the
   KEK from the KEMRecipientInfo structure.

   Implementations MUST randomly generate content-encryption keys,
   content-authenticated-encryption keys, and message-authentication
   keys.  Also, the generation of KEM key pairs relies on random
   numbers.  The use of inadequate pseudo-random number generators
   (PRNGs) to generate these keys can result in little or no security.
   An attacker may find it much easier to reproduce the PRNG environment
   that produced the keys, searching the resulting small set of
   possibilities, rather than brute force searching the whole key space.
   The generation of quality random numbers is difficult.  [RFC4086]
   offers important guidance in this area.

   If the cipher and key sizes used for the key-encryption and the
   content-encryption algorithms are different, the effective security
   is determined by the weaker of the two algorithms.  If, for example,
   the content is encrypted with AES-CBC using a 128-bit CEK, and the
   CEK is wrapped with AES-KEYWRAP using a 256-bit KEK, then at most 128
   bits of protection is provided.

   If the cipher and key sizes used for the key-encryption and the
   content-authenticated-encryption algorithms are different, the
   effective security is determined by the weaker of the two algorithms.
   If, for example, the content is encrypted with AES-GCM using a
   128-bit CAEK, and the CAEK is wrapped with AES-KEYWRAP using a
   192-bit KEK, then at most 128 bits of protection is provided.

   If the cipher and key sizes used for the key-encryption and the
   message-authentication algorithms are different, the effective
   security is determined by the weaker of the two algorithms.  If, for
   example, the content is authenticated with HMAC-SHA256 using a
   512-bit message-authentication key, and the message-authentication
   key is wrapped with AES-KEYWRAP using a 256-bit KEK, then at most 256
   bits of protection is provided.

   Implementers should be aware that cryptographic algorithms, including
   KEM algorithms, become weaker with time.  As new cryptoanalysis
   techniques are developed and computing capabilities advance, the work
   factor to break a particular cryptographic algorithm will be reduced.
   As a result, cryptographic algorithm implementations should be
   modular, allowing new algorithms to be readily inserted.  That is,
   implementers should be prepared for the set of supported algorithms
   to change over time.

8.  IANA Considerations

   For KEMRecipientInfo in Section 3, IANA has assigned the object
   identifier (OID) for (1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.13.3) in the "SMI
   Security for S/MIME Other Recipient Info Identifiers" registry
   (1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.13), and the Description for the new OID has
   been set to "id-ori-kem".

   For the ASN.1 Module in Section 6.1, IANA is requested to assign an
   object identifier (OID) for the module identifier to replace TBD3.
   The OID for the module should be allocated in the "SMI Security for
   PKIX Module Identifier" registry (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.0), and the
   Description for the new OID should be set to "id-mod-
   kemAlgorithmInformation-2023".

   For the ASN.1 Module in Section 6.2, IANA is requested to assign an
   object identifier (OID) for the module identifier to replace TBD2.
   The OID for the module should be allocated in the "SMI Security for
   S/MIME Module Identifier" registry (1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.0), and the
   Description for the new OID should be set to "id-mod-cms-kemri-2023".
